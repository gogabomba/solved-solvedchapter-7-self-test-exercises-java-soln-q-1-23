Although we did not discuss it when we covered the class StringTokenizer, the class StringTokenizer has a method with the following heading: public Object nextElement() The method nextElement() returns the same string as the method nextToken(), but nextElement() returns it as something of type Object, as opposed to type String. Give a suitable definition of nextElement to add to the definition of EnhancedStringTokenizer. This definition will override the definition of nextElement in the class StringTokenizer. (Hint : the definition is just like the definition of nextToken except for fixing the type of the string returned.)
